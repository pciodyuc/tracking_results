This package includes raw results files for the ECO tracker [1] on four datasets:

- OTB-2015 [2] (which also includes OTB-2013 [3])
- TempleColor [4]
- UAV123 [5]
- VOT2016 [6]

The generated raw results files used in the paper [1] are included for both the ECO and ECO-HC trackers. 

The result files for OTB-2015 and TempleColor are saved in the same format used in the OTB-2013 evaluation toolkit [3]. But the naming convention of the files might differ from the original verison of the OTB-2013 toolkit. This can be easily solved using some file renaming utility or script.
