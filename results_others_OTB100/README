<<1. Sequence List>>
"seq_list_50.txt" is sequence list of the benchmark[1].
"seq_list_100.txt" is sequence list of the entire dataset[2].


<<2. Format of File Name>>
Each file name has the from "{{sequence_name}}_CNN-SVM.mat"


<<3. Format of Result File>>
3-1. Result files has compatible format with tracker benchmark code, which can be downloaded at [2].

3-2. Each "{{seqence_name}}_DSMT.mat" file has a single cell "results"
"results{1}" has three variables
    1. res - a single matrix which rows are bounding box coordinates(Left, Upper, Width, Height) and 1-based indexing.
    2. len - length of tracking result
    3. type - type of res ('rect')
